# sql-challenge

I inspected the provided CSV files and created table schemas for all tables and showed the structure of the data and how different entities are related to each other.
After creating table schemas, I imported the data from the provided CSV files into the corresponding tables and correctly ordered the creation of tables to handle foreign keys to avoid integrity constraints violations during data insertion.

After setting up the database, I answered the following questions 
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

These questions helpd understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, which can be valuable for decision-making and reporting purposes.

This assignment provides an opportunity to practice various SQL concepts, including data modeling, table creation, data manipulation, and querying. It was a struggle creating the table schemas but after office hours and referring back to the class recordings I understood what needed to be done to fix the importing errors and the foriegn keys issues i had.
